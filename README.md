This project is from the course Build Python Django eCommerce website with advanced custom functionalities, RDS Postgres and deploy it on Amazon AWS.
It's one of the courses I have done on the topic with the Udemy platform.

The course assumes a backend developer recieving a website project static files; HTML, CSS/Bootstap, javaScript(various flavours)
and has to modify the code using Django then deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
